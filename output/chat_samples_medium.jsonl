The given expression is \"-4389 - (-903 * 629)\". According to the order of operations (PEMDAS), we should first perform multiplication before subtraction, including considering negative signs.\n2. So, let's calculate -903 * 629: \n   903 * 629 = 572847\n   Since there is a negative sign in front of 903, the result will be negative as well:\n   -903 * 629 = -572847\n3. Now, replace this value back into the original expression: \"-4389 - (-572847)\".\n4. Next, we need to simplify \"-(-572847)\". According to the mathematical principle that \"negative of a negative equals positive\", we get:\n   -(-572847) = 572847\n5.
