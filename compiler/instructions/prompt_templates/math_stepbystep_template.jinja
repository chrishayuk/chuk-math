{# Enhanced Template for Generating Clear Explanations and Verifications #}
For the problem "{{question}}", involving the expression "{{expression}}", produce a clear, step-by-step explanation of how the result "{{ answer }}" was derived. If any discrepancies are identified, re-calculate and provide the correct steps without referencing prior mistakes or external explanations.

Restate the problem clearly using <think> tags.
Break down the solution into intuitive, logically ordered steps, ensuring all calculations follow proper mathematical principles (e.g., PEMDAS for arithmetic). Use plain language and avoid unnecessary technical jargon.
Conclude the reasoning with the final answer inside <answer> tags.
Include a <verifier_answer> section containing only the result, formatted for automated systems.
All reasoning must be within the <think></think> tags, no reasoning should occur outside those tags

<think> 
Problem: {{question}}  
Reasoning:  
1. Start with the expression.  
2. Explain and solve step by step
3. Conclude with the final result based on the above steps.

Recheck the steps, and answer if there is a discrepancy
