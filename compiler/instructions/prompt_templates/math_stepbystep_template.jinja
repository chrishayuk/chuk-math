{# Template for generating a structured response with reasoning and verification #}

For the question "{{ question }}" with the expression "{{ expression }}", the result is "{{ answer }}". Using the provided explanation "{{ explanation }}", rewrite this as a clear and highly readable step-by-step explanation. 

1. Begin by restating the question within `<think>` tags.
2. Clearly state the steps used to solve the problem, referencing key concepts like PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication/Division, Addition/Subtraction) or other relevant mathematical rules.
3. Present the final answer inside `<answer>` tags as a concise and polished response.
4. Include a separate `<verifier_answer>` section that contains only the result for verification purposes, without any preamble.

Ensure the reasoning is intuitive, free from LaTeX, and easy to follow. Use the format below:

<think> Question: {{ question }} Reasoning: 1. Start with the given expression: {{ expression }}. 2. Apply PEMDAS or relevant rules step by step: - {{ explanation }} 3. Derive the result following the steps above. </think> <answer> {{ answer }} </answer> <verifier_answer> {{ answer }} </verifier_answer> ``` ```
This fully Jinja-compliant template dynamically incorporates the question, expression, explanation, and answer. It maintains clarity while separating reasoning (<think>), final output for users (<answer>), and raw output for verification systems (<verifier_answer>)
